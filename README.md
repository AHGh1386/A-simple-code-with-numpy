# A-simple-code-with-numpy
A simple code about Extrapolation with using numpy. 

### 1 - Divide the numbers into two sets.

### 2 - Perform the necessary calculations for each set.

### 3 - Solve the equations.

## Explanation:

Divide Numbers: The function divide_numbers splits the first n natural numbers into two sets.

Calculate Coefficients: The function calculate_coefficients calculates the sums of x, x^2, and y values. Here, I assumed y values are the same as x values for simplicity.

Solve Equations: The function solve_equations uses numpy to solve the linear equations for coefficients a and b.

Main Function: This function ties everything together by dividing the numbers, calculating the sums, solving the equations, and printing the results.

You can change the value of n in the example usage section to suit your needs. If you have specific values for y different from x, you can modify the calculate_coefficients function accordingly.
